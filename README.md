### Mission

**ARTOOL is born from the industrial need to speed up development cycle, bringing augmented reality in manufacturing. Using our proprietary software, the virtual CAMs worlds will enter in the shop floors, reducing from-art-to-part time and increasing efficiency in maintenance workflow, boosting productivity and killing production lead time.**

Debug | Simulate | Maintenance

Debug the origin definitions of the CNC. The Augmented Reality device is directly connected to the controller | Simulate the trajectory defined in your part program against the real working area | Find the failed components and order them online if necessary; no need to inspect complex schematics

Measure | Inspection | Collision

3D precise measuring tool, that is extremely fast that allows you to use machine origins, for shop-floor written code | Inspect the scene and check your CAM design against in machine defined origins | Identify catastrophic collisions and guarantee machine survival against your youngest technician
